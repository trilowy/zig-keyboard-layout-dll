# Zig keyboard layout DLL

## Compile

- Install Zig 0.13.0
- ```sh
  zig build-lib -O ReleaseFast -target x86_64-windows-msvc -dynamic bepolar.zig --subsystem native
  ```


## Work In Progress

I attempted to translate a C file generated by MSKLC for the [Bepolar] layout.
The goal is to not depend on Windows H files or environment to
generate a Windows keyboard layout driver on any OS with [Kalamine].

I kept most of the names and comments to ease the translation of C code. All
necessary files (under copyright) are in the [MSKLC] installation folder
(`inc/` contains all the header files). With wkalamine and the Bepolar TOML you
can generate the Bepolar C file.

Later, Kalamine might be able to generate the required structs and launch Zig
compilation if I manage to make the DLL work.


## WARNING

Do not try to use the generated DLL in the current state of the project, itâ€™s
buggy and prevents Windows to start!
